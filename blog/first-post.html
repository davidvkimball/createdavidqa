<h2>First post</h2>

<p>This one-word domain name has gone dormant for too long.</p>
<p>Finally figured out a great use for the "QA" top-level domain: questions and answers about making websites!</p>
<p>Making websites is so fun. My first site was from 2006, and while the writing was poor, and the content overall was of questionable quality, I certainly enjoyed it.
    Something about the "old web" seemed to encourage spontaneity, more creativity, and was OK with being a little rough around the edges.
That's something I miss a lot about the internet - now the top-most visited sites feel overly polished and lifeless.</p>
<p>This is hardly a manifesto, but writing this reminds me of many proclamations I've read recently from old web proponents decrying the state of modern social media. 
    "Taking back the internet" is an often-echoed sentiment, wanting to return to a time with direct feeds rather than having to succumb to the whims of an algorithm.</p>
    <p>David.qa's goal is nothing crazy - simply to make website creation a little more accessible. Whether you want to make a smol website, or a modern slick website, personal sites are the best and not that difficult to make.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this will go anywhere or be anything of note. But hopefully someone will get use out of it.</p>
