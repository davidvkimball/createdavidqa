<h2>Is catering to both the new web and the old web futile?</h2>

<p>Last night I had a ponder.</p>
<p>Is it possible to participate in both the old web revival while also maintaining a current presence on the modern web?</p>
<p>Well it's obviously physically possible, but are you somehow betraying the edicts of the yesterweb powers that be? 
  Many retreat to the old web not just for nostalgia and self-expression, but to escape from the status quo.
</p>
<p>What can be said, then, for someone who enjoys both like me? Am I creating this website for an audience of one?</p>
<p>On one hand, it seems silly to try and pretend the current state of the web doesn't exist, as we're benefiting from certain modernizations like a more secure protocol for browsing, HTML5 and CSS3 standards, and even pretty fancy JavaScript in some cases.</p>
<p>On the other, I can see why incorporating too much of the modern web would defeat the purpose of enjoying something that's intended to feel like another era.</p>
<p>In an ideal scenario, I'd participate in both "worlds" fully as myself and share resources to both the old-web craving audience and the current-day average users (who may be completely unaware of the old web revival in the first place).</p>
<p>Especially for those who never experienced it, I see create.david.qa as a gateway drug to enjoy a simpler, more personalized online experience. And I would love for anyone to experience it.</p>
<p>It's staggering just how many amazing tools are made and put out for free - not only to keep the old web going, but also more modern tools that would satisfy the needs of your current-day webmaster.</p>
<p>I'm going to keep working on this project as I have time and am able, and hopefully by doing so I'm not alienating either audience. I know I won't please everyone, but I'd like for this to be a useful resource people trust.</p>
